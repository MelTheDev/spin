# Preparing your server
::lead-p
Spin gives you the power to choose any host that you want. Although the responsibility is on your shoulders to get a server set up, Spin makes it very easy to get this accomplished.
::

## Choose a host
We've run [VPS Benchmarks against a number of hosts](https://521dimensions.notion.site/VPS-Benchmarks-for-Self-hosters-c6eca7c5f16d4bb8aeb989174fc58ffe?pvs=4) and have found the following hosts to have great value. The links below are referral links, meaning we get a small kickback if you sign up -- but this doesn't affect our recommendations.

### Hetzner
Hetzner is a German-based company with data centers in the EU and the US. Their pricing is very competitive and they have incredible performance.

With the link below, they offer ‚Ç¨‚Å†20 (~$21 USD) credits free which can get you a server for a few months.

### Vultr
Vultr is a US-based company that has a great reputation for performance and value. They have a wide range of data centers around the world and a great API for automation.

With the link below, they are offering $100 in credits -- which can get you quite a bit for a few months.

### Digital Ocean
Digital Ocean is a US-based company that has data centers all around the world. Although their performance generally lacks compared to other providers, there are so many resources that natively support their offerings.

With the link below, they are offering $200 in credits over 60 days.

### Any other host
Spin is host-agnostic, meaning you can run Spin anywhere. If you have a preferred host, you can use them as well. Just make sure that your host meets the following requirements:

- Gives you root access to a system running **Ubuntu 22.04+**
- Allows root SSH access
- Has backup/snapshot services (highly recommended)
- It's usually best for you run this on a **brand new server** with a fresh installation

## Prepare your DNS
Once you have a server running with the host of your choice, it's recommended to configure your DNS to have two A records created pointing to the IP address of your server.

Two records should be created:

1. Application Domain Name (example: `myapp.example.com`)
2. Server Hostname (example: `server01.example.com`)

## Validate your SSH connection
Before you start, make sure you can SSH into your server **using an SSH key pair**. Many hosts do this by default, but you need to follow your hosts instructions for adding a trusted public key that can connect to your server. If you need help generating an SSH key, you can follow our guide on [Generating a Secure SSH Key](/docs/advanced/generating-a-secure-ssh-key).

 You can do this by running the following command:

::note
We're assuming your host provisions their Ubuntu images as `root` as the default user. Use whatever standard your host uses, just as long as it has root access.
::

::code-panel
---
label: "SSH into your server"
---
```bash
ssh root@myserver01.example.com
```
::

## Ensure your server is up to date
On your server, it's good practice to ensure everything is updated. Run this command below to update all packages on your server. Restarting the server is a good idea too to ensure everything is up to date.

::code-panel
---
label: "Update your server"
---
```bash
apt -y update && apt -y upgrade && apt -y autoremove && apt -y autoclean && reboot
```
::


## Configure server inventory and settings
Assuming you've already ran [`spin new`](http://localhost:3000/open-source/spin/docs/command-reference/new) or [`spin init`](http://localhost:3000/open-source/spin/docs/command-reference/init) in your project, there are two files that will need to be configured:
- `.spin-inventory.ini`
- `.spin.yml`

#### Inventory
We call the list of our servers "inventory". This follows the [Ansible Inventory format](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html). For example, if you wanted to add `server01.example.com` as the production server, we would configure our file to look like this and add this server to go underneath the `production_manager_servers` group:

::code-panel
---
label: ".spin-inventory.ini: Add `server01.example.com` to Production"
---
```ini
####################
# Host Types
####################

[production_manager_servers]
server01.example.com

[staging_manager_servers]
# server02.example.com

####################
# Swarm Roles
####################
[swarm_managers:children]
production_manager_servers
staging_manager_servers

####################
# Environment
####################
[production:children]
production_manager_servers

[staging:children]
staging_manager_servers

[all_servers:children]
production
staging
```
::

## Configure other server settings
In the `.spin.yml` file, you will find many other settings. There are a few things that you will want to check here:

#### üëâ Required to be changed

| Key | Description |
|-----|---|
| `server_contact` | Change this to a valid email. **If you're using our Traefik templates**, you'll also need to change the `letsencryptresolver.acme.email` key under the `.infrastructure/conf/traefik/prod/traefik.yml` file. | 
| `docker_user.authorized_ssh_keys` | OPTIONAL: Use this only if you're having something like GItHub Actions connect as the Docker User. This must be the **public key** of the your [dedicated SSH keypair that you generated](/docs/advanced/generating-a-secure-ssh-key).
| `users.username` | Set this to a username that you'll remember. Be sure to not use any weird characters. |
| `users.password` | Set this to the secure hash of the password you'd like to use. All users will be prompted to change on first login. Use [`spin mkpasswd`](/docs/command-reference/mkpasswd) to quickly generate a hash.|
| `users.username.authorized_ssh_keys` | Set this to **your _public_ SSH key value**. ‚ö†Ô∏è The key pair must be accessible under `~/.ssh` on your host. Most of the time the file ends in `*.pub`.|

### Use the template below to set users and their authorized keys
## Passwords must be set with an encrypted hash. To do this, see the Ansible FAQ.
## Your best bet is probably using the `mkpasswd` on a Linux machine.

## Run `spin provison`
Once you have `.spin.yml` and `.spin-inventory.ini` configure, you're ready to provision your server(s).

::note
Notice how we're using `--user root` in the command below. This is because most hosts provision `root` as the default user. 

By default `spin provision` will attempt to connect over SSH using the username on your workstation (how SSH works by default). Since your server doesn't come with your username already created, we need to connect as `root` on our first provision so Spin can configure the accounts configured in `.spin.yml`.
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Provision your server(s)"
---
```bash
spin provision --user root
```
::

This process will automatically download [our Ansible collection](https://github.com/serversideup/ansible-collection-spin) and apply the changes on your server.

## Confirm everything works
To confirm everything works as expected, try to SSH into your server using the username you created before. You will be prompted to change your password to a new password as soon as you login.

::code-panel
---
label: "Connect to your server via SSH"
---
```bash
ssh myuser@server01.example.com
```
::

If you get a connection, you should be ready to receive deployments to Docker Swarm via SSH ü•≥
