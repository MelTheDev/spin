## Pre-requisites
You must have a working installation of Docker.

::note
Most Docker documentation will push you to install "Docker Desktop" on your Linux machine. This is completely unnecessary in our opinion. Instead of "Docker Desktop", we suggest installing the "Docker Engine" instead.
::

### Install Docker Engine

Install "Docker Engine" following the official installation instructions:
- [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)
- [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) (NOT for Ubuntu. Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for Ubuntu)
- [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
- [RHEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/)
- [SLES](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/sles/)
- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Raspbian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/raspberry-pi-os/)
- [Binaries](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/)

### Configure Docker permissions
Using the [post-installation instructions defined by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/), be sure to add your current user to the `docker` group if you want to be able to run Docker without root privileges.

::code-panel
---
label: Create the `docker` group
---
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Add your current user to the `docker` group.
---
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Activate the changes to groups.
---
```bash
newgrp docker
```
::

### Ensure Docker is working
To test you have a working version of Docker, you can run their "hello world" container. `docker version`.

::code-panel
---
label: Run a "hello world" container to ensure Docker works correctly
---
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
::

### Check your Docker Compose Version
Spin is set to run the latest version of Docker Compose (Version 2).


::code-panel
---
label: Check your Docker Compose version
---
```bash
docker compose version
```
::

If you do not see version 2.x installed, you'll need to update. [ How to Install Docker Compose V2 â†’](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#install-on-linux)


## Download and install `spin`
Run the installer with this simple command in your terminal

::code-panel
---
label: Install Spin (no root permissions required)
---
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/spin/main/tools/install.sh)"
```
::

The above script will install spin at the _user_ level in `~/.spin`, using less than 300KB of storage.

## Configuring your PATH variable
By default, Spin will ask if you want to add it to your PATH variable. You may need to "source" the file after your first installation.

::note
Run `echo $0` in your terminal to figure out which shell you are using.
::

::code-panel
---
label: Use the "source" command to apply your profile changes immediately
---
```bash
# If you're using ZSH
source ~/.zshrc

# If you're using Bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```
::

## Add `spin` to your PATH
In order for your terminal to know where `spin` is located, we need to add this to your "PATH" for your shell. Depending on your shell, you will need to **paste the following text at the BOTTOM of the appropriate file**:

## Configuring your PATH variable manually
If you did not add `spin` to your PATH during the installation, you can manually add it to your PATH by adding this to your shell profile:
::code-panel
---
label: Add spin to your path
---
```bash
# Add this to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`
export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"
```
::

## Validate it's working
You should be able to run this and get a result ðŸ¥³

::code-panel
---
label: Confirm spin is working correctly by getting the version
---
```bash
spin version
```
::
