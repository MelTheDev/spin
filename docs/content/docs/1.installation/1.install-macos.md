## Install Docker Desktop
MacOS does not ship with Docker by default. To get Docker installed, you will need "Docker Desktop", which is the official desktop tool developed by Docker.

[Learn how to install Docker Desktop â†’](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)

## Download and install `spin`
Once Docker is installed, you are now ready to install `spin`. Run the installer with this simple command in your terminal. **No root permissions required.**

::code-panel
---
label: Install spin to your machine (no root permissions required)
---
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/spin/main/tools/install.sh)"
```
::

The above script will install spin at the _user_ level in `~/.spin`, using less than 300KB of storage.

## Configuring your PATH variable
By default, Spin will ask if you want to add it to your PATH variable. You may need to "source" the file after your first installation.

::note
Run `echo $0` in your terminal to figure out which shell you are using.
::

::code-panel
---
label: Use the "source" command to apply your profile changes immediately
---
```bash
# If you're using ZSH
source ~/.zshrc

# If you're using Bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```
::

## Add `spin` to your PATH
In order for your terminal to know where `spin` is located, we need to add this to your "PATH" for your shell. Depending on your shell, you will need to **paste the following text at the BOTTOM of the appropriate file**:

## Configuring your PATH variable manually
If you did not add `spin` to your PATH during the installation, you can manually add it to your PATH by adding this to your shell profile:
::code-panel
---
label: Add spin to your path
---
```bash
# Add this to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`
export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"
```
::

## Validate it's working
You should be able to run this and get a result ðŸ¥³

::code-panel
---
label: Confirm spin is working correctly by getting the version
---
```bash
spin version
```
